    OS Process Management & Memory Management Simulation

    This program simulates operating system process management and
    memory management. See the README for full details.

    This class merely bootstraps the instantiation of a Simulator, passing
    it to `PApplet.main`. This `main` class method establishes a graphics
    context for Processing, and calls `Simulator#setup` once, and then calls
    `Simulator#draw` over and over again.

    }
